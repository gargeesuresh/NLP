# NLP
I have built a sequential model with keras that will try and predict whether a Sentence is sarcastic or not.
for training the model, I have used the dataset provided by [RishabMishra](https://github.com/rishabhmisra) in [News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection#:~:text=To%20overcome%20the%20limitations%20related,categories%20(which%20are%20sarcastic).)
