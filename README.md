* __Sarcasm detector__ -
  I have built a basic sequential model with keras that will try and predict whether a Sentence is sarcastic or not.
  for training the model, I have used the dataset provided by [RishabMishra](https://github.com/rishabhmisra) in [News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection](https://github.com/rishabhmisra/News-Headlines-Dataset-For-Sarcasm-Detection#:~:text=To%20overcome%20the%20limitations%20related,categories%20(which%20are%20sarcastic).)
* __text classification on IMDB data-set using Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN)__
* __Real-time Insights from twitter data__ -
  Using Real-time data collected from Twitter, I have analysed twitter trends(at the time) by comparing world trends to US Trends, understanding the overlap between the trends, and have found interesting insights. The trend I explored happens to be [Earth (Lil Dicky song)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_(Lil_Dicky_song)) which was trending both in The US and WorldWide #WeLoveTheEarth.
